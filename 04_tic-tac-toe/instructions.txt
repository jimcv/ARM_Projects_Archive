Setup:
    This project uses the "VGA pixel buffer" and the "PS/2 keyboard" of the simulator
    They can be found inside panels on the right column
    The panels can be dragged around
    The pixel buffer can be resized to see better (hover the little arrow on top left corner)
    The simulator offers two PS/2 devices, the one used in this project is at address "ff200100"

How to play:
    Click on the box next to "Type here" in the PS/2 keyboard at address "ff200100"
    The controls are the num-keys of the keyboard (row above the letters, NOT the numpad)
    
    - Type "0" to start/restart the game
    - Type "1" to "9" to place a mark in one of the 9 squares, numbered from left to right, top to bottom
    - The game stops when a player wins, or when the board results in a draw
